# Airbnb Investment

The purpose of this mini project was to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive business insights. 

### Business Context
I am working for a client who wishes to invest in an AirBnB hotel in Amsterdam. Before my client decides to invest, they would like clean data about AirBnB performance in Amsterdamâ€™s markets that ultimately supports a clear recommendation for an investment in a specific market.

### Airbnb Dataset
I have been provided with scraped data captured by a web program that pulled listing information from the AirBnB website; this data may contain unformatted data points with duplicate entries. I have cleansed and formated the data prior to performing exploratory analysis, which will help me better understand the available data and build some business sense.

### Problem Statement
1. Should our investor invest in an AirBnB hotel in Amsterdam?
2. And, if so, which neighborhood should they invest in?
